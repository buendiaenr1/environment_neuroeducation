"""""""is arsenic exposure a risk factor for metabolic syndrome? a review of the potential mechanisms. exposure to arsenic in drinking water is a worldwide health problem. this pollutant is associated with increased risk of developing chronic diseases, including metabolic diseases. metabolic syndrome (ms) is a complex pathology that results from the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. this condition increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. the ms includes at least three of the following signs, central obesity, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, and hypertension. here, we summarize the existing evidence of the multiple mechanisms triggered by arsenic to developing the cardinal signs of ms, showing that this pollutant could contribute to the multifactorial origin of this pathology."""""""
"""""""are electrophysiological and oligodendrocyte alterations an element in the development of multiple sclerosis at the same time as or before the immune response? efficient communication between the glial cells and neurons is a bi-directional process that is essential for conserving normal functioning in the central nervous system (cns). neurons dynamically regulate other brain cells in the healthy brain, yet little is known about the first pathways involving oligodendrocytes and neurons. oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells in the cns that are needed for the propagation of action potentials along axons and additionally serve to support neurons by neurotrophic factors (nfts). in demyelinating diseases, like multiple sclerosis (ms), oligodendrocytes are thought to be the victims. axonal damage begins early and remains silent for years, and neurological disability develops when a threshold of axonal loss is reached, and the compensatory mechanisms are depleted. three hypotheses have been proposed to explain axonal damage: 1) the damage is caused by an inflammatory process; 2) there is an excessive accumulation of intra-axonal calcium levels; and, 3) demyelinated axons evolve to a degenerative process resulting from the lack of trophic support provided by myelin or myelin-forming cells. although ms was traditionally considered to be a white matter disease, the demyelination process also occurs in the cerebral cortex. recent data supports the notion that initial response is triggered by cns injury. thus, the understanding of the role of neuron-glial neurophysiology would help provide us with further explanations. we should take in account the suggestion that ms is in part an autoimmune disease that involves genetic and environmental factors, and the pathological response leads to demyelination, axonal loss and inflammatory infiltrates."""""""
"""""""effect of ultra-processed diet on gut microbiota and thus its role in neurodegenerative diseases. the current dietary pattern is characterized by high consumption of ultra-processed foods and lower consumption of fiber and vegetables, environmental factors that are associated directly with the current incidence of chronic metabolic diseases. diet is an environmental factor that influences the diversity and functionality of the gut microbiota, where dietary changes have a direct action on their homeostasis. the environment created in the gut by ultra-processed foods, a hallmark of the western diet that are recognized as trigger factors for low-grade systemic inflammatory and oxidative changes, favor the development of neurodegenerative diseases (nds). from a systematic search, the present review analyzes the relationship and effect of the current feeding pattern, with the dysregulation of the microbiota and its influence on the development of cognitive decline. because diagnosis of nds is usually at late stages, this review highlights the importance of a search for stricter public health strategies regarding access to and development of ultra-processed foods."""""""
"""""""exploring the dendritic spine pathology in a schizophrenia-related neurodevelopmental animal model. schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder identified by psychotic episodes, as well as cognitive deficits. there are reports of multiple alterations in the brain in schizophrenia, such as fewer dendritic spines with shape abnormalities in cortical and subcortical areas. a correlation has been established between shape and function in dendritic spines; and as the main site of excitatory synapses, the dendritic spine pathology represents a potential target for novel therapeutic tools in schizophrenia. neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (nvhl) in the rat has been extensively used to examine some of the pathophysiological mechanisms of schizophrenia since it mimics several behaviors, as well as abnormalities in morphological corticolimbic neurons. thus, in this report, we determined the effects of the nvhl on locomotor behavior and memory in postpubertal rats. also, we explored the density and the dynamics of the dendritic spines in the pyramidal neurons of layers 3 and 5 of the prefrontal cortex (pfc) and basolateral amygdala (bla), and also in the nucleus accumbens (nacc) medium spiny neurons (msn). we found that nvhl rats have exhibited both hyperlocomotion and memory deficits. nvhl also reduced the number of dendritic spines and decreased the proportion of mature spines in these neurons. in conclusion, nvhl triggers behavioral abnormalities in postpubertal rats that can be associated not only with the lack of dendritic spines but also with distortion of these structures in corticolimbic neurons. hence, the nvhl can be useful to explore the mechanisms of the dendritic spine pathology and its implications for schizophrenia."""""""
"""""""interactions between epilepsy and plasticity. undoubtedly, one of the most interesting topics in the field of neuroscience is the ability of the central nervous system to respond to different stimuli (normal or pathological) by modifying its structure and function, either transiently or permanently, by generating neural cells and new connections in a process known as neuroplasticity. according to the large amount of evidence reported in the literature, many stimuli, such as environmental pressures, changes in the internal dynamic steady state of the organism and even injuries or illnesses (e.g., epilepsy) may induce neuroplasticity. epilepsy and neuroplasticity seem to be closely related, as the two processes could positively affect one another. thus, in this review, we analysed some neuroplastic changes triggered in the hippocampus in response to seizure-induced neuronal damage and how these changes could lead to the establishment of temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common type of focal human epilepsy."""""""
"""""""voluntary physical activity improves spatial and recognition memory deficits induced by post-weaning chronic exposure to a high-fat diet. childhood and adolescent exposure to obesogenic environments has contributed to the development of several health disorders, including neurocognitive impairment. adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental window highly influenced by environmental factors that affect brain function until adulthood. post-weaning chronic exposure to a high-fat diet (hfd) adversely affects memory performance; physical activity is one approach to coping with these dysfunctions. previous studies indicate that voluntary exercise prevents hfd's detrimental effects on memory; however, it remains to evaluate whether it has a remedial/therapeutical effect when introduced after a long-term hfd exposure. this study was conducted on a diet-induced obesity mice model over six months. after three months of hfd exposure (without interrupting the diet) access to voluntary physical activity was provided. hfd produced weight gain, increased adiposity, and impaired glucose tolerance. voluntary physical exercise ameliorated glucose tolerance and halted weight gain and fat accumulation. additionally, physical activity mitigated hfd-induced spatial and recognition memory impairments. our data indicate that voluntary physical exercise starting after several months of periadolescent hfd exposure reverses metabolic and cognitive alterations demonstrating that voluntary exercise, in addition to its known preventive effect, also has a restorative impact on metabolism and cognition dysfunctions associated with obesity."""""""

"""""""role of brain extracellular vesicles in air pollution-related cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. a relationship between environmental exposure to air pollution and cognitive impairment and neurological disorders has been described. previous literature has focused on the direct effects of the air pollution components on neuronal and glial cells, as well as on involvement of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation on microglia and astrocyte reactivity. however, other mechanisms involved in the air pollution effects on central nervous system (cns) toxicity can be playing critical roles. increasingly, extracellular vesicle's (evs) mediated intercellular communication is being recognized as impacting the development of cognitive impairment and neurological disorders like alzheimer's disease and others. here we describe the available evidence about toxic air pollutants and its components on brain, an involvement of brain cells specific and evs types (based in the origin or in the size of evs) in the initiation, exacerbation, and propagation of the neurotoxic effects (inflammation, neurodegeneration, and accumulation of neurotoxic proteins) induced by air pollution in the cns. additionally, we discuss the identification and isolation of neural-derived evs from human plasma, the most common markers for neural-derived evs, and their potential for use as diagnostic or therapeutic molecules for air pollution-related cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration."""""""
"""""""effects of high dietary carbohydrate and lipid intake on the lifespan of <i>c. elegans</i>. health and lifespan are influenced by dietary nutrients, whose balance is dependent on the supply or demand of each organism. many studies have shown that an increased carbohydrate-lipid intake plays a critical role in metabolic dysregulation, which impacts longevity. <i>caenorhabditis elegans</i> has been successfully used as an in vivo model to study the effects of several factors, such as genetic, environmental, diet, and lifestyle factors, on the molecular mechanisms that have been linked to healthspan, lifespan, and the aging process. there is evidence showing the causative effects of high glucose on lifespan in different diabetic models; however, the precise biological mechanisms affected by dietary nutrients, specifically carbohydrates and lipids, as well as their links with lifespan and longevity, remain unknown. here, we provide an overview of the deleterious effects caused by high-carbohydrate and high-lipid diets, as well as the molecular signals that affect the lifespan of <i>c. elegans</i>; thus, understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of high-glucose- and lipid-induced changes in whole organisms would allow the targeting of key regulatory factors to ameliorate metabolic disorders and age-related diseases."""""""
"""""""gsk3β and tau protein in alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common form of dementia present in older adults; its etiology involves genetic and environmental factors. in recent years, epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between ad and chronic epilepsy since a considerable number of patients with ad may present seizures later on. although the pathophysiology of seizures in ad is not completely understood, it could represent the result of several molecular mechanisms linked to amyloid beta-peptide (aβ) accumulation and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which may induce an imbalance in the release and recapture of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, structural alterations of the neuronal cytoskeleton, synaptic loss, and neuroinflammation. these changes could favor the recurrent development of hypersynchronous discharges and epileptogenesis, which, in a chronic state, favor the neurodegenerative process and influence the cognitive decline observed in ad. supporting this correlation, histopathological studies in the brain tissue of temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) patients have revealed the presence of aβ deposits and the accumulation of tau protein in the neurofibrillary tangles (nfts), accompanied by an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (gsk3β) activity that may lead to an imminent alteration in posttranslational modifications of some microtubule-associated proteins (maps), mainly tau. the present review is focused on understanding the pathological aspects of gsk3β and tau in the development of tle and ad."""""""
"""""""epigenetic variations due to nutritional status in early-life and its later impact on aging and disease. epigenetics refers to changes in gene function, not resulting from the primary dna sequence, influenced by the environment. it provides a link between the molecular regulation of the genome and the environmental signals exposed during the life of individuals (including lifestyle, social behavior, development, and nutrition). notably, early development (intrauterine or postnatal) is highly influenced by the adverse socioeconomic status that leads to malnutrition or obesity; these conditions induce changes over the fetal epigenetic programming and can be transferred by transgenerational inheritance, inducing alterations of the transcription of genes related to several metabolic and neurological processes. moreover, obesity during pregnancy, and excessive gestational weight gain are associated with an increased risk of fatal pregnancy complications, and adverse cardio-metabolic, respiratory and cognitive-related outcomes of the future child. however, most of our knowledge in this field comes from experimental animal models, that partially resemble the nutritional effects of humans. in this context, nutritional effects implicated in historical famines represent valuable information about the transgenerational effects of undernutrition and stress. in the present review, we attempt to describe the most outstanding results from the most studied famines about the impact of malnutrition on the epigenome."""""""
"""""""therapeutic strategies for ketosis induction and their potential efficacy for the treatment of acute brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. the therapeutic use of ketone bodies (kb) against acute brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders has lately been suggested by many studies. several mechanisms responsible for the protective action of kb have been described, including metabolic, anti-inflammatory and epigenetic. however, it is still not clear whether a specific mechanism of action can be associated with a particular neurological disorder. different strategies to induce ketosis including the ketogenic diet (kd), caloric restriction (cr), intermittent fasting (if), as well as the administration of medium chain triglycerides (mcts), exogenous ketones or kb derivatives, have been used in animal models of brain injury and in humans. they have shown different degrees of success to prevent neuronal damage, motor alterations and cognitive decline. however, more investigation is needed in order to establish safe protocols for clinical application. throughout the present review, we describe the different approaches that have been used to elevate blood kb and discuss their effectiveness considering their advantages and limitations, as tested in models of brain injury, neurodegeneration and clinical research. we also describe the mechanisms of action of kb in non-pathologic conditions and in association with their protective effect against neuronal damage in acute neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases."""""""
"""""""autophagy stimulation decreases dopaminergic neuronal death mediated by oxidative stress. the neurodegenerative process of parkinson's disease (pd) involves autophagy impairment and oxidative stress. therefore, we wanted to determine whether stimulation of autophagy protects dopaminergic cell death induced by oxidative stress in a pd model. since environmental exposure to herbicides increases the risk to develop pd, the experimental model was established using the herbicide paraquat, which induces autophagy disruption, oxidative stress, and cell death. rapamycin-stimulated autophagy inhibited calpain-dependent and independent apoptosis induced by paraquat. autophagy stimulation decreased oxidative stress and peroxiredoxins (prxs) hyperoxidation induced by paraquat. cells exposed to paraquat displayed abnormally large autophagosomes enclosing mitochondria, which correlates with an increase of p62, an essential mitophagy regulator. interestingly, when autophagy was stimulated before paraquat treatment, autophagosome size and number were similar to that observed in control cells. motor and cognitive function impairment induced by paraquat showed an improvement when preceded by autophagy stimulation. importantly, dopaminergic neuronal death and microglial activation mediated by paraquat were significantly reduced by rapamycin-induced autophagy. our results indicate that autophagy stimulation has a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons and may have a promising potential to prevent or delay pd progression."""""""
"""""""effect of ozone exposure on dendritic spines of ca1 pyramidal neurons of the dorsal hippocampus and on object-place recognition memory in rats. the growth of many cities has generated an increase in the emission of environmental pollutants. exposure to these pollutants has been associated with increased mortality worldwide. these pollutants, such as ozone, produce reactive oxygen species (ros), which cause oxidative stress throughout the body. it has been observed that there is a relationship between chronic oxidative stress and the development of degenerative diseases typical of old age such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, and huntington's disease. the purpose of this research was to evaluate whether chronic exposure to ozone produces a deleterious effect on density and morphology of dendritic spines in ca1 of dorsal hippocampus and on learning and memory of object-place recognition. rats were exposed to ozone or to ozone-free air for a period of 15, 30, 60, or 90 days. the principal results indicate that chronic oxidative stress induced by ozone produces a decrease in the density of dendritic spines, a decrease in thin and mushroom spine ratios, and an increase in stubby spine ratio, as well as a deficit in learning and memory of the object-place recognition task. these results indicate that chronic ozone exposure produces a loss in the inputs of ca1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus, which may be the source of the cognitive deficits observed in the object-place recognition task, as indicated by the decrease in density of dendritic spines; these alterations are similar to those reported in some neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease."""""""

"""""""pollution and health: a progress update. the lancet commission on pollution and health reported that pollution was responsible for 9 million premature deaths in 2015, making it the world's largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death. we have now updated this estimate using data from the global burden of diseases, injuriaes, and risk factors study 2019. we find that pollution remains responsible for approximately 9 million deaths per year, corresponding to one in six deaths worldwide. reductions have occurred in the number of deaths attributable to the types of pollution associated with extreme poverty. however, these reductions in deaths from household air pollution and water pollution are offset by increased deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and toxic chemical pollution (ie, lead). deaths from these modern pollution risk factors, which are the unintended consequence of industrialisation and urbanisation, have risen by 7% since 2015 and by over 66% since 2000. despite ongoing efforts by un agencies, committed groups, committed individuals, and some national governments (mostly in high-income countries), little real progress against pollution can be identified overall, particularly in the low-income and middle-income countries, where pollution is most severe. urgent attention is needed to control pollution and prevent pollution-related disease, with an emphasis on air pollution and lead poisoning, and a stronger focus on hazardous chemical pollution. pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss are closely linked. successful control of these conjoined threats requires a globally supported, formal science-policy interface to inform intervention, influence research, and guide funding. pollution has typically been viewed as a local issue to be addressed through subnational and national regulation or, occasionally, using regional policy in higher-income countries. now, however, it is increasingly clear that pollution is a planetary threat, and that its drivers, its dispersion, and its effects on health transcend local boundaries and demand a global response. global action on all major modern pollutants is needed. global efforts can synergise with other global environmental policy programmes, especially as a large-scale, rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy is an effective strategy for preventing pollution while also slowing down climate change, and thus achieves a double benefit for planetary health."""""""
"""""""pharmacological strategies to improve dendritic spines in alzheimer's disease. to deeply understand late onset alzheimer's disease (load), it may be necessary to change the concept that it is a disease exclusively driven by aging processes. the onset of load could be associated with a previous peripheral stress at the level of the gut (changes in the gut microbiota), obesity (metabolic stress), and infections, among other systemic/environmental stressors. the onset of load, then, may result from the generation of mild peripheral inflammatory processes involving cytokine production associated with peripheral stressors that in a second step enter the brain and spread out the process causing a neuroinflammatory brain disease. this hypothesis could explain the potential efficacy of sodium oligomannate (gv-971), a mixture of acidic linear oligosaccharides that have shown to remodel gut microbiota and slowdown load. however, regardless of the origin of the disease, the end goal of load-related preventative or disease modifying therapies is to preserve dendritic spines and synaptic plasticity that underlay and support healthy cognition. here we discuss how systemic/environmental stressors impact pathways associated with the regulation of spine morphogenesis and synaptic maintenance, including insulin receptor and the brain derived neurotrophic factor signaling. spine structure remodeling is a plausible mechanism to maintain synapses and provide cognitive resilience in load patients. importantly, we also propose a combination of drugs targeting such stressors that may be able to modify the course of load by acting on preventing dendritic spines and synapsis loss."""""""
